In spring 2020, Multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children (MIS-C) was reported in association with COVID-19, often following mild or asymptomatic infection. The course of the disease varies from mild to life-threatening, with approximately 25% of children requiring intensive care. Genetic factors, as well as environmental factors such as comorbidities, socioeconomic status, and living conditions may influence the risk of MIS-C. This study examines risk factors, including socioeconomic and ethnic aspects, to identify children at increased risk and improve preventive interventions. Data were collected by linking to national registries.
