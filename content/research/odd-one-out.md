In comparison to other European nations, Sweden implemented fewer restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19. This chapter examines the institutional framework and principles of crisis management that probably influenced Sweden’s approach, alongside a summary of the non-pharmaceutical interventions that shaped daily life. Rather than enforcing lockdowns, Sweden relied on voluntary actions of individuals. The government encouraged behavioural change through recommendations, while substantial enhancements to Sweden’s already robust welfare system mitigated the adverse effects for individuals who chose to work from home, self-isolate, or care for vulnerable family members. Nonetheless, as the pandemic continued, progressively stricter measures were introduced for individuals and businesses.

Using proxy measures derived from administrative registers, the study explores how social inequalities in physical and mental health, gender inequalities in unpaid care work, and the impact of remote work for unemployment risks evolved throughout the different phases of the pandemic. These analyses demonstrate that while patterns of inequality underwent moderate shifts during the most intense phases, particularly the first wave, these shifts were temporary. Ultimately, inequalities in the examined outcomes remained largely stable once the pandemic subsided.
