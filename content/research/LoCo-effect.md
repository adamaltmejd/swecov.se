The COVID-19 pandemic placed a heavy social and health burden on populations. Yet, because of potential social inequalities in the pandemic's impact on fertility behaviour, babies conceived during the pandemic may be the most socially advantaged and healthiest birth cohort of the last decades.

In this project, we will use register-based data to analyse changes in the socioeconomic composition of parents during the COVID-19 pandemic and estimate to what extent potential differences in perinatal outcomes between children born and conceived during the pandemic and earlier cohorts are caused by changes in parental composition.
