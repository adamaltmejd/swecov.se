# Predictors of COVID-19 Outcomes Among Residents of Swedish Long-Term Care Facilities–A Nationwide Study of the Year 2020

**What is the primary question addressed by this study?** This study examines predictors for SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death among residents of long-term care facilities (LTCFs), using Swedish nation-wide data for the whole pandemic year of 2020.

**What is the main finding of this study?** We found that several factors were associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection and COVID-19 death. All-cause dementia was a particularly strong predictor of COVID-19 death, especially among those aged 65-75 years.

**What is the meaning of the finding?** These results provide important information on individual-level risk factors associated with negative COVID-19 outcomes, which is essential for adequate risk management in LTCFs during this and future pandemics.
