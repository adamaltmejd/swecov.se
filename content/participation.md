## Background

The broad purpose of SWECOV (the Research Program in the following) is to answer three research questions:

  1.	What are the consequences of COVID-19 – as well as the interventions and reforms implemented to stop the spread of the disease – on public health, in terms of mortality and morbidity, but also psychological and physiological well-being more broadly?
  2.	What are the consequences of the pandemic – as well as the interventions and reforms implemented to stop the spread of the disease – for central social and economic outcomes, like jobs, income and inequality?
  3.	Based on the experiences of the pandemic, what can individuals, professionals and policy makers do to mitigate the spread of future pandemics and limit their social, economic, and health consequences?

We believe that these broad questions are best answered if studied with the best available data, preferably linked individual-level data from a multitude of sources. We also believe that the questions are best answered if studied from multiple perspectives, by scholars from different disciplines. We have therefore set up a process for researchers to participate in the program, which is described below.

Program participants work in separate research projects. Each project covers a specific question and should result in a single publication. Data is accessed through MONA – the digital platform for data processing provided by Statistics Sweden. To minimize the risks to personal integrity, access is only granted to project-relevant data. Furthermore, for data security and privacy reasons – and consistent with Statistic Sweden’s interpretation of current European and Swedish law – access is only available from within the EU, or from third countries providing "adequate protection" according to the European Commission.

Participation is free. But the research program offers no financial support for the research itself beyond access to the data. Moreover, participating researchers are expected to take an active role in the activities of the program and contribute to overall program development. This includes improving the data infrastructure, for example by sharing program codes and newly created indexes or variables, documentation, and practical know-how of working with specific data sources. It also includes presenting research in common seminars and workshops, discussing other participants’ work, and general sharing of expertise.

## Application process

If you wish to participate in the Research Program, please send us an application of no more than three pages.  An application should typically cover work that will result in a single scientific paper. We discourage broad applications. If the research generates additional questions relevant to the program, we encourage additional applications.

Make sure that your application document answers the questions in the following checklist:

  1.	What is the purpose of your project and how does it relate to the goals of the Research Program?
  2.	Is your project consistent with the prevailing ethical permission of the program (see below)?
  3.	How does your project relate to previous work on the topic and what is the scientific relevance of the specific question you would like to study?
  4.	What is the expected research output of your project?
  5.	Who will be the responsible researcher?
  6.	Which are the other participating researchers who require access to data? Please motivate each instance of required data access.

The program’s steering committee – its current members are found [here](../aboutus/) – meets four times per year. On these occasions, the committee will evaluate new project applications. The committee will decide whether or not the proposed project falls under the general questions of the program – as operationalized by the program's ethical permission – and if the proposal is of sufficient scientific merit.

Applicants are encouraged to contact the program coordinators when preparing their applications to ask general questions and get access to the ethical permission. We will not provide any advance notices about participation. But the coordinators can give advice on appropriate formulations to those who wish to mention prospective program participation in a funding application.

We will look positively on multidisciplinary projects, but a project that spans more than one discipline is no prerequisite for application.

The following research principals participate in the project: Stockholm university. All researchers with data access need to be employed at one of these institutions. Should your institution not be listed, contact the program coordinators for further instructions.

New program participants will have to agree with specific conditions. These include a specification of the exact data used, a project time plan, and rules for co-authorship. Participants will also be expected to work actively on the project, starting right away. This is in order to ensure that the research carried out corresponds to the application and that the research that has been approved is carried out.
