# Register-based research on COVID-19 in Sweden
SWECOV is a multidisciplinary research collaboration focused on using quantitative methods and comprehensive register data about the whole Swedish population to answer important questions about the consequences of the pandemic. Find all our ongoing and published research under [Research](/research/).

SWECOV is **open** to researchers who are interested in answering our [broad research questions](/about_swecov/#purpose). Due to the size of the project, and the sensitive [individual-level data](/about_swecov/#purpose) that our researchers work with, we have a formalized application process and adhere to strict data security standards. For more information about how to apply to participate in the project, look under the "[Join us](/participation/)" page.
