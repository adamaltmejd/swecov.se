Disease transmission models can provide valuable information for decision makers on the likely future spread of SARS-CoV-2 under different policy scenarios. We aim to integrate real-world mobility data - a key factor affecting social contact patterns – into surveillance models.

The results will provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of real-world data from mobile phone operators for predicting infectious disease transmission over time and space. Furthermore, they generate valuable experiences for real-time disease modelling using mobility data for managing potential future health crises.
