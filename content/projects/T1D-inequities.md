A recent study found increases in the risk to develop type-1-diabetes (T1D) among children up to 4 years and young men. These increases could not be fully attributed to a potential triggering effect of COVID-19. Therefore, it seems like other pathways, such as environmental or behavioral factors, played a role during the pandemic. In this study, we aim to identify in which population groups, defined by different socio-economic factors, the risk to develop T1D was elevated.
