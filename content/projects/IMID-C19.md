Immune-mediated inflammatory diseases (IMIDs) are rising globally, potentially driven by environmental changes, infections, and other factors. Both COVID-19 infections and vaccinations may influence IMID risk, but evidence remains limited. This study examines associations between COVID-19 infections, vaccinations, and IMID incidence using Swedish registry data. Analytical methods include interrupted time series, Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score matching. The findings aim to shed light on IMID risks associated with COVID-19 and support equitable public health strategies to address the pandemic's potential long-term impacts.
