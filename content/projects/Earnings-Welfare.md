# Earnings losses and the role of the welfare state during the COVID-19 pandemic: evidence from Sweden

In addition to being the most acute public health crisis in recent decades, the COVID-19 pandemic led to rapid and substantial GDP losses in the second quarter of 2020: up to 9.1 percent for the US, 7.6 percent in Sweden, and 11.4 percent for the European Union. Like many countries, Sweden already had an encompassing government transfer system before the pandemic. Yet the governments saw a need to extend existing government transfers and introduce new measures to dampen the expected negative impact of the pandemic on individual incomes and businesses. In addition to increasing the generosity and reach of government transfers to individuals, Sweden followed other countries and introduced new and substantial firm support measures, such as short-time work allowance, to preserve employment relationships and save jobs.

In this project, we estimate the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on labor earnings across the income distribution and for various groups in the labor market. We also analyze the degree to which already existing government transfer systems and newly introduced pandemic measures compensated for these earnings losses. To this end, we use monthly administrative data on labor earnings, social insurance benefits, and means-tested income transfers for the universe of the Swedish working-age population. To analyze the causal impact of the pandemic on earnings and transfers, we use a difference-in-differences approach in which we compare affected and unaffected population cohorts. Our results reveal that, in 2020, almost half of the losses in labor earnings were protected by already existing government transfers and pandemic measures. We also show that earnings losses affected groups differently. By and large, however, the welfare state evened out these differences in earnings losses.
