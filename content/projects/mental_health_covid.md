This project investigates the risk of mental illness among individuals diagnosed with COVID-19 and their family members in Sweden. Using nationwide register data from SWECOV, we will assess how COVID-19 disease severity influences the development of mental health conditions such as depression, anxiety, and suicidal behavior. The study includes two large cohort analyses comparing individuals with and without COVID-19, and their relatives, to explore the psychological impact of infection, hospitalization, and bereavement. By linking COVID-19 records to health, medication, and demographic registers, the project will provide comprehensive insights into the long-term mental health burden of the pandemic.
