The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored and intensified pre-existing social and health inequalities globally. In Sweden, despite a comprehensive welfare system and universal health coverage, growing research shows that the health burden of the pandemic was not evenly distributed. This proposal aims to explore how the pandemic impacted pregnancy outcomes in Sweden, with a specific focus on migration background and intersectional socio-economic inequalities. We will analyze how these factors intersect and influence maternal and perinatal health outcomes across different waves of the pandemic.
