This project explores how changes to Sweden’s unemployment insurance (UI) system during the COVID-19 pandemic influenced job search outcomes and labor market mobility. In response to rising unemployment, the Swedish government temporarily expanded UI access and generosity – reducing the membership requirement and increasing benefit levels. Using nationwide register data, we study whether unemployed individuals shifted toward more stable sectors and how the UI reforms affected job-finding rates, job quality, and firm characteristics. The project applies causal methods – including regression discontinuity and regression kink designs – to assess the impact of policy changes on employment trajectories during a time of economic disruption.
