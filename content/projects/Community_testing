Early detection is important to limit further spread of infectious diseases with human-to-human transmission. In communities with low testing propensity, there is a higher risk of undetected cases and unmitigated transmission. Vulnerable groups who live in communities with low testing propensity may therefore be at higher risk of severe disease outcomes compared to similar groups in communities with higher testing propensity.

The aim of this study is to investigate to what extent community testing contributed to protection of i) persons born outside Sweden, ii) persons with one or several medical risk factors iii) older persons living at nursing homes, three groups that were especially affected by severe COVID-19 morbidity.
