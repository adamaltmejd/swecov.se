Sweden experienced high numbers of COVID-19 deaths in the early phases of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. This can be at least partly due to a “dry tinder effect” – a high proportion of frail individuals that were alive at the onset of the pandemic due to a mild pre-pandemic influenza season. We aim at quantifying such changes in population frailty in relation to mortality trends triggered by the recurrent influenza season and the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic using individual-level data on comorbidities from health records.
