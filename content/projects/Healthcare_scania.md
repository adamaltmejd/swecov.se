To date, there are few studies of COVID-19 that examine inequalities in COVID-19 across the full spectrum of disease severity, from calling the health information hotline to death, and across different levels of health care. The SWECOV data available for the county of Scania provide a unique opportunity to address this issue and also to examine differences in individual pathways through the health care system. This study will examine the social gradients in COVID-19-related outcomes of different severity levels. It will also examine how social inequalities manifest themselves in the medical history leading up to hospitalisation and in subsequent outcomes.
