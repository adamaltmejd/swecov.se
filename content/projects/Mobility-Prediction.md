Accurate predictions of disease transmission during early phases of pandemics are crucial for informing decisions about resource allocation and disease control measures. The aim of this study is to test the suitability of mobility data to increase the accuracy of disease transmission models. The first weeks of the COVID-19 outbreak in Sweden in 2020 are used as a case study.

To measure disease transmission-relevant mobility, different data sources are combined. Firstly, travel volumes between the 290 municipalities are estimated from anonymized mobile phone data from the largest mobile phone operator will be taken. Secondly, information on the number of returnees to Sweden will be retrieved from credit card usage data on foreign transactions. These data are merged with demographic and health data from public registry data.

The results of this study will provide information on the utility of currently available mobility data as well as a workflow for their integration with registry data for disease outbreak modelling.
