Infectious diseases pose significant public health challenges, and epidemiological models play a crucial role in understanding their dynamics, guiding public health interventions, and informing effective control strategies during outbreaks. In this study, we aim to develop an extended SEIR model that incorporates public health recommendations based on calls to Sweden's 1177 hotline. This model will be used to evaluate the impact of these recommendations on early detection and disease transmission control. It will estimate the basic reproduction number (R₀) across different stages of the outbreak. Sensitivity analysis will be conducted to examine how variations in key parameters, such as transmission rates or hotline-driven interventions, influence model outcomes, enabling the identification of the most significant factors affecting disease spread and intervention effectiveness.
