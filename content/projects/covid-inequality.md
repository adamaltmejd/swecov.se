The pandemic hit a world characterized by social, economic and health inequalities. Vulnerable groups may be likely to suffer several types of negative consequences of the pandemic. Because of disciplinary boundaries, the full impact of the pandemic for different groups is difficult to ascertain. Using administrative data from Sweden, we show that groups that are at high risks of severe COVID-19 also experienced higher risks of several other negative life events during the pandemic. We find that migrants and individuals with low education are more likely to experience severe covid but also higher all-cause mortality, unemployment risk, substantial income loss and reduced access to health care. Migrants are especially afflicted by COVID, unemployment and income loss while maintaining an advantage in all-cause mortality. Men were more afflicted directly by COVID while women experienced more indirect consequences, though generally the differences are small.

Our results corroborate that the coronavirus pandemic is an exceptional event that had a profound impact on several aspects of life. The groups that were at a disadvantage before the pandemic were also the most likely to experience both severe COVID and other negative life event during the pandemic. Considering multiple types of outcomes hint at the true extent of the consequences of the pandemic and demonstrate that the pandemic can not be understood within the confines of a single discipline. The prevention and mitigation of future pandemics depend on the success of interdisciplinary collaboration.
