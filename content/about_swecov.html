<h1 id="purpose">Purpose</h1>
The broad purpose of the SWECOV project is to answer two research questions:
<ol>
  <li>What are the consequences of COVID-19—as well as the interventions and reforms implemented to stop the spread of the disease—on public health, in terms of mortality and morbidity, but also psychological and physiological well-being more broadly?</li>
  <li>What are the consequences of the pandemic—as well as the interventions and reforms implemented to stop the spread of the disease—for central social and economic outcomes, like jobs, income and inequality?</li>
</ol>
<p>By answering these questions, we aim to provide individuals, professionals, and policy makers with knowledge to help mitigate the spread of future pandemics and limit their social, economic, and health consequences. We believe that these broad questions are best answered if studied with the best available data, preferably linked individual-level data from a multitude of sources. We also believe that the questions are best answered if studied from multiple perspectives, by scholars from different disciplines. We have therefore organized the project to be open for researchers and set up an application process to <a href="/participation/">join SWECOV</a>.</p>

<h1 id="Background">Background</h1>
<p>SWECOV (officially <i>Ett forskningsprogram om covid-19 i Sverige: Smittspridning, bekämpning och effekter på individer och samhälle</i>) was started by Professor Torsten Persson in collaboration with the <a href="https://www.regeringen.se/rattsliga-dokument/statens-offentliga-utredningar/2022/02/sou-202210/">Swedish Corona Commission</a>. Professor Persson, who was also a member of the commission, realized that it would be crucial for the commission to support new research in order to properly fulfill its task.</p>
<p>During its working period, which ended with the publication of a final report in February 2022, the Corona Commission supported the research in SWECOV, chiefly by financing data purchases from different registers. In early 2022, the board of Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (The Riksbank Tercentenary Foundation) took a decision to support the continuation of SWECOV—as a major data source and network for research about the pandemic and its consequences—with a generous four-year grant.</p>

<h1 id="data">Data</h1>
The SWECOV project has collected individual-level and aggregate data from many Swedish authorities. Most sources cover the full Swedish population. This section provides an overview of the different data sources that we make use of to answer the research questions above. All data is either anonymous (aggregated) or pseudonymized, where any personal identifiers have been replaced with random numbers. This allows us to link data from different sources at the individual level without knowing the identities of the study population. All data is stored and accessed through <a href="https://www.scb.se/vara-tjanster/bestall-data-och-statistik/mikrodata/mona---leveranssystemet-for-mikrodata/">MONA</a>, the secure data environment ran by Statistics Sweden.
