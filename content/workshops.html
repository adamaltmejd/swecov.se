    SWECOV hosts a yearly research workshop where we invite project members and other researchers working on the COVID-19 pandemic to present and discuss their work. The workshops provide an opportunity for scholars working in different fields to network and share their knowledge as well as discuss hands-on issues with experts in economics, demography, epidemiology and medicine, and develop new research ideas and collaborations. During the workshops, we also discuss future directions for the project. The programs from 2023 and 2024 can be found here.
