# SWECOV.se

This site is built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using the [research-project-theme](https://github.com/adamaltmejd/research_project_theme). To build the site locally, make sure you have [Hugo installed](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) (extended version recommended) and run:

```bash
hugo serve
```

# Testing
During local development, make sure you have the depencies installed locally and remove the comments before the "replace" directives in `go.mod`. This will link the local modules for development.
